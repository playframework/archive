# Play 1.0.x Releases

Usually, you can find Play Framework 1 zip bundles attached to their corresponding GitHub release pages - for example: https://github.com/playframework/play1/releases/tag/1.8.0, which includes the download link: https://github.com/playframework/play1/releases/download/1.8.0/play-1.8.0.zip

Unfortunately, in the early days of the Play Framework 1 repository, some very early releases did not receive a Git tag.
Therefore, those early zip bundles have been collected in this folder.

**Be aware**: These are legacy releases.
They are deprecated, no longer maintained, and may contain known security vulnerabilities.
These files are provided **as-is, for archival or migration purposes only**.
