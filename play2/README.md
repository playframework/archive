# Play 2.0.x - 2.3.x Releases

You can find early Play Framework 2 zip bundles attached to their corresponding GitHub release pages - for example: https://github.com/playframework/playframework/releases/tag/2.1.4, which includes the download link: https://github.com/playframework/playframework/releases/download/2.1.4/play-2.1.4.zip

Starting with Play 2.4, dedicated zip bundles are no longer provided, as Play switched to using vanilla [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/).

**Be aware**: These are legacy releases.
They are deprecated, no longer maintained, and may contain known security vulnerabilities.
These files are provided **as-is, for archival or migration purposes only**.
